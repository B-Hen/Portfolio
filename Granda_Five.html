                <p>Granada Five is a side scrolling RPG platformer. It was made as an academic project in a group of 4. It was written in C# and made in monogame.
                 I had the role of production manager. I made and set a schedule for my group mates that helped us get things done by the due date and helped us finish 
                 the game on time. I also worked on creating/implementing the player, enemies, weapons, and projectiles, as well as debugging and adding extra features 
                 such as sound and health packs.This game was made back when I was a freshman in Spring 2019 and it was my very first game.</p>
